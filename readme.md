# Overview #

This is a basic JavaScript web application that allows users to search Github.com for repositories by keyword.

Please find the requirements below, there is no one way to complete the exercise so you can be creative within the below-mentioned boundaries.

## Requirements ##

1. All the logic has to be in the app.js.
2. You can choose a javascript library or framework of you choice to solve this exercise.
3. index.html contains two elements: one for the search term and one for the results.
4. The results should show as a list with each item in an "owner/name" format.

4.a Paginate the results every 5 records (bonus)
5. When a result is clicked, display an alert with the repositories' 'language', 'followers', 'url' and 'description'.
6. The search term should be cached so duplicate searches do not trigger same requests over and over again. 
7. Bring in your favourite front-end framework to make the interface responsive
